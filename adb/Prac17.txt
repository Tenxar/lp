use universityDB;

db.instructors.insertMany([
  { instructor_id: 1, first_name: "Saurabh", last_name: "Sharma", department: "IT", salary: 50000, status: "Approved" },
  { instructor_id: 2, first_name: "John", last_name: "Doe", department: "Computer Science", salary: 45000, status: "Approved" },
  { instructor_id: 3, first_name: "Saurabh", last_name: "Gupta", department: "Mathematics", salary: 40000, status: "Not Approved" },
  { instructor_id: 4, first_name: "Emily", last_name: "Davis", department: "IT", salary: 55000, status: "Approved" },
  { instructor_id: 5, first_name: "Michael", last_name: "Wilson", department: "Computer Science", salary: 42000, status: "Not Approved" },
  { instructor_id: 6, first_name: "Sarah", last_name: "Miller", department: "IT", salary: 60000, status: "Approved" },
  { instructor_id: 7, first_name: "David", last_name: "Taylor", department: "Computer Science", salary: 48000, status: "Not Approved" },

]);

âœ… Step 2: Execute the Queries on the instructors Collection

db.instructors.find({ instructor_id: { $nin: [1, 2, 3] } });

db.instructors.find({
  $and: [

    { department: { $ne: "Computer Science" } }
  ]
});

d. Display Details of Instructors Whose Department Has the Substring "e"

db.instructors.find({ department: /e/ });

Summary of Queries Demonstrated:

    Find Documents by ID: Using $in to find instructors by their IDs.

    Exclude Documents by ID: Using $nin to exclude instructors with specific IDs.

    Complex Query with Conditions: Using $and, $gte, and $ne for more specific conditions like salary and department.

    Substring Search: Using a regular expression (/e/) to find departments with the substring "e".
