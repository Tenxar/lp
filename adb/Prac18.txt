Create Instructor collection and execute following queries
a. Display details of instructor whose City has substring n
b. Find details of instructor whose Dept has substring mec and h
c. Find out instructor id, first name, department name along with salary
where salary< 50000 and status is approved
d. Find out details of instructors who have salary<30000



Step 1: Create instructors Collection and Insert 10 Records

use universityDB;

db.instructors.insertMany([
  { instructor_id: 1, first_name: "Saurabh", last_name: "Sharma", department: "Mechanical Engineering", salary: 50000, status: "Approved", city: "New York" },
  { instructor_id: 2, first_name: "John", last_name: "Doe", department: "Computer Science", salary: 45000, status: "Approved", city: "Chicago" },
  { instructor_id: 3, first_name: "Saurabh", last_name: "Gupta", department: "Mathematics", salary: 40000, status: "Not Approved", city: "San Francisco" },
  { instructor_id: 4, first_name: "Emily", last_name: "Davis", department: "Mechanical Engineering", salary: 55000, status: "Approved", city: "Austin" },
  { instructor_id: 5, first_name: "Michael", last_name: "Wilson", department: "Computer Science", salary: 42000, status: "Not Approved", city: "Houston" },
  { instructor_id: 6, first_name: "Sarah", last_name: "Miller", department: "Information Technology", salary: 60000, status: "Approved", city: "New Jersey" },
  { instructor_id: 7, first_name: "David", last_name: "Taylor", department: "Computer Science", salary: 48000, status: "Not Approved", city: "Denver" },
  { instructor_id: 8, first_name: "Anna", last_name: "Moore", department: "Physics", salary: 38000, status: "Approved", city: "Boston" },
  { instructor_id: 9, first_name: "James", last_name: "Anderson", department: "Mechanical Engineering", salary: 53000, status: "Approved", city: "Philadelphia" },
  { instructor_id: 10, first_name: "Laura", last_name: "Thomas", department: "Mathematics", salary: 47000, status: "Not Approved", city: "Miami" }
]);

âœ… Step 2: Execute the Queries on the instructors Collection
a. Display Details of Instructors Whose City Has the Substring "n"

db.instructors.find({ city: /n/ });

b. Find Details of Instructors Whose Department Has the Substrings "mec" and "h"

db.instructors.find({
  department: /mec/,
  department: /h/
});

c. Find Instructor ID, First Name, Department Name, and Salary Where Salary is Less Than 50000 and Status is "Approved"

db.instructors.find(
  { salary: { $lt: 50000 }, status: "Approved" },
  { instructor_id: 1, first_name: 1, department: 1, salary: 1 }
);

d. Find Details of Instructors Who Have Salary Less Than 30000

db.instructors.find({ salary: { $lt: 30000 } });

Summary of Queries Demonstrated:

    Substring Search in City: Using a regular expression (/n/) to find cities that contain the substring "n".

    Multiple Substring Search in Department: Using regular expressions (/mec/ and /h/) to find departments with specific substrings.

    Field Selection with Query Conditions: Using find() to retrieve specific fields (instructor_id, first_name, department, salary) where salary is less than 50,000 and status is "Approved".

    Salary Condition: Using a query to find instructors with a salary less than 30,000.
